        <p>Ice cream is a soft, creamy treat made by freezing milk, cream, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients. For hundreds of years, ice cream has been a popular treat, but refrigeration has made it more common. There are many ice cream variations, including frozen custard, frozen yogurt, and even non-dairy versions made with coconut milk, due to ice cream's exploding popularity.</p>
